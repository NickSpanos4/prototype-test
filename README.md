Prototype test for Immersive Tech


# Project Summary

This was a fun challenge to work through as it has been a bit since I used Unity so I needed to do some polishing and updating of my skills in order to meet the challenge. I will be up front and state that I did need to use a tutorial for the keypad system as I did not know how to tackle it with my previous knowledge. I felt it was necessary in order to meet the design requirement, rather than creating a workaround, to make it fun. Here is the link to the tutorial I used: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAAG-JczuGY

For the major elements of the prototypes, the first room contains the puzzle where the player must input a key based on the clues in the rooms. To solve it, the player needs to match the book colours and what amount they are (4 green books, 7 red books, 9 blue books) and input the code accordingly. I was inspired to make this solution after first importing the interior asset pack, seeing the three book types and thining "Hey, that would make a good clue system based off the design criteria".

The second room contains a puzzle where the player must drop in the correct amount of books into the containers in order for the door to open based on the clues around the room. As I had creative freedom on how I approached this room, I decided to use some mechanics I knew about unity - in this case dragging and dropping objects - and apply them into a short puzzle solving sequence.

What I learned the most from this exercise is that I need to maintain my patience when working with scripts, as it helped me solve multiple issues I encountered over the course of the prototypes development. One specific example was the winning timer system I wanted to implement, where I needed to figure out things like 'why isn't the text enabling properly' and 'why is the scene not resetting once the countdown completes'. When I took my time to go through each issue to understand what was happening, I managed to get everything to work! I may not be the fastest but I am methodical.

**What I would do if I had more time:** If I spent more time with this project I would get the timer system to work better off each other, i.e. the main timer stops if the player reaches the end, figure out a better text display system for more polish, and a more intricate leve/room setup for better immersion.
